    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Effective February 19, 2026</p>

    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of Invoke Wisdom ("the App"). By using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>What Invoke Wisdom Does</h2>
    <p>Invoke Wisdom uses artificial intelligence to help you find quotes, stories, and principles relevant to real-world challenges. The App is designed as a tool for reflection and learning.</p>

    <h2>AI-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>All wisdom content in the App is generated by artificial intelligence. While we strive for accuracy and quality, you should be aware that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quotes may be paraphrased, misattributed, or inaccurately represented</li>
        <li>Stories and historical examples may contain factual errors</li>
        <li>Principles and advice may not be appropriate for your specific situation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You are responsible for independently verifying any content before relying on it in professional, academic, published, or consequential contexts. Invoke Wisdom is not a substitute for professional advice of any kind.</p>

    <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>

    <p>We are not liable for any damages arising from your use of the App, including but not limited to reliance on AI-generated content, data loss due to device issues, or service interruptions. Our total liability to you for any claim arising from or related to the App shall not exceed the amount you paid for the App.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Invoke Wisdom name, design, and original code are our intellectual property. AI-generated wisdom content is provided for your personal use. You may share individual pieces of wisdom as permitted by the App's share functionality.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
